          From a newly graduated student or an experienced professional in the field, looking for a new job can be 
          highly demanding and intimidating. Websites which confer fraudulent job positions or allow risks of 
          personal identity theft must be strictly avoided. With the increasing number of job portals which lists 
          different jobs during different times, it becomes a frustrating experience. It was becoming laborious 
          to continually check and change expectations of the individual to receive best results and new roles 
          which had been posted.

          We already have a plethora of data on the search, from LinkedIn, indeed, Glassdoor etc., that host many 
          opportunities per day. Rushing into interviews with only a few offers leads to settling for lesser offers 
          can induce great struggle in the future. But have you ever noticed that usually, they all contain 
          different jobs? So, how about we scrap the data from these websites to build a collective job search 
          portal? The main idea of the project is to scrap popular job portal websites and obtain information like 
          the date of the job posting, salary details, job industry, company name, etc. Then, the problem statement 
          writes as an automated, combined job search portal which enables newest information on job position 
          meeting the demands of the user. And, to handle this huge amount of information from many different job 
          websites such as LinkedIn, Naukri, indeed etc, weâ€™ll be using the method of Data Scraping.
