# Job-portal-automation
This project is a job portal automation tool that aims to streamline the process of gathering job data from three popular websites: Naukri, Glassdoor, and Monster. By scraping relevant information from these sites, the tool creates a database of job listings for a particular requirement. The tool then filters and displays the top 100 job results, removing any duplicated jobs across the three websites.
